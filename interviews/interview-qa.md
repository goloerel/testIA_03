Role: QA/Testing Engineer

Interviewer: What is your preferred test structure and naming convention?

User: I prefer the Given-When-Then naming structure. It should be simple but specific, such as test_get_vehicle_not_found.

Interviewer: How should the test environment be handled?

User: I prefer using a real Docker container for the database rather than mocks to ensure accuracy.
